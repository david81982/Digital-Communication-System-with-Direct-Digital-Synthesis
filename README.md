# Digital-Communication-System-with-Direct-Digital-Synthesis
The final code used in TTU Digital Communications Project Lab (ECE-3334-302)


Full Project description:

Digital Communication System with Direct Digital Synthesis:  Design and construct 
a wireless communication system that takes an ASCII alpha-numeric input and produces 
a modulated RF signal using DDS.  Amplify the modulated carrier signal and transmit 
the signal wirelessly.  Select an appropriate carrier signal frequency.
